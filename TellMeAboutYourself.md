# Job Interview Strategies: What Recruiters Expect

This video provides insights from an ex-Google recruiter on how to strategically answer common interview questions.

## General Advice:
•	Interviews are strategic, not just honest: The goal is to be strategic, not just honest (0:06, 1:17, 11:41).
•	Shift your mindset: Treat interviews as a meeting between two parties with something to offer, not an audition (2:16).

## Key Questions & Strategic Answers:

### 1. "How are you?" (0:35)
•	What they're looking for: Your ability to regulate energy and professionalism, even on a bad day (1:06, 1:17).
•	What to answer: "I'm great, thank you. How are you?" (1:10)
•	Why: Shows you can manage your energy when it matters, and the interview starts the moment you walk in (1:19, 1:24).

### 2. "Why do you want to work here?" (1:31)
•	What they're looking for: What you can do for them, not what you want from them (1:50, 2:11).
•	What to answer: Focus on solving their problems and contributing to their goals. For example: "I've outgrown my current role and I'm looking for a new challenge. Based on what I've seen about this team's goals, I know I can help you solve [insert problem]." (2:01)
•	Why: Generic answers about mission and values tell them nothing (1:37, 1:43).

### 3. "Where do you see yourself in 5 years?" (2:30)
•	What they're looking for: If you'll leave quickly and if your goals align with the role (2:44, 2:46).
•	What to answer: Express commitment to this role and becoming an expert within the company. For example: "I see myself here. I see myself becoming an expert in this area and I'm a valuable part of this team." Connect it to specific aspects of the job (3:14, 3:23).
•	Why: Avoid mentioning plans to leave (grad school, starting a business) or being vague (3:01, 3:06).

### 4. "Why are you looking for a new opportunity?" (3:36)
•	What they're looking for: Professionalism and growth, not negativity about past employers (3:56, 4:01).
•	What to answer: Keep it clean and positive. "I've learned a lot in my current role, and now I'm ready for a new challenge." (4:13)
•	Why: Trashing a former employer makes you seem like a risk (3:56, 4:07).

### 5. "How do you feel about your current manager?" (4:29)
•	What they're looking for: Absence of negativity, especially since the interviewer could be your next boss (4:37, 5:25).
•	What to answer: Frame your growth in a positive light without criticizing. For example: "My manager has been great at providing structure for our team's goals. I've learned a lot about process from him, and as I've grown, I've become more proactive in anticipating next steps and I'm excited about the possibility of bringing that proactive energy to a new team." (5:34)
•	Why: Negative comments can be misinterpreted or reveal misalignments with the interviewer's style (4:44, 5:08).

### 6. "Your hobbies." (5:54)
•	What they're looking for: Curiosity, engagement, and memorable qualities that make you interesting (6:10, 6:41).
•	What to answer: Choose a hobby that paints a picture of who you are and showcases positive traits like patience, problem-solving, or curiosity. For example: "Outside of work, I'm an avid home baker. I actually run a small Instagram page where I document my attempts to mastering sourdough. It's taught me a lot about patience, process, and troubleshooting when things don't rise as expected." (7:04)
•	Why: Generic hobbies like watching TV or hanging out with friends make you forgettable (6:21, 6:32).

### 7. "Your job title and description." (7:22)
•	What they're looking for: Accurate representation of the work you've actually done, especially if it was above your pay grade or title (7:27, 7:48).
•	What to answer: Own the work you've done, even if it didn't align with your official title. For example: "While my title was marketing coordinator, I was responsible for leading the Q3 email campaign from concept to execution. This involved setting the strategy, coordinating the design and copy, analyzing the AB test results, and presenting the 15% lift in engagement to leadership." (8:25)
•	Why: Don't undersell yourself; HR titles don't always reflect the true value you created (7:50, 8:04).

### 8. "Resume gaps." (8:48)
•	What they're looking for: Confidence and clarity, not defensiveness or apologies (9:41, 9:50).
•	What to answer: Be matter-of-fact. If it was for school/certification/volunteer work, explain what you learned. If layoffs, state there were layoffs. If personal, simply say "I took time off for personal reasons and now I'm ready to return to work." (9:09, 9:18, 9:25)
•	Why: The gap itself is rarely a deal-breaker since you got the interview; how you present it is key (8:56, 9:50).

### 9. "Do you have any questions for us?" (10:20)
•	What they're looking for: Your interest level, how you think, and if you're picturing yourself in the role (10:31, 10:43).
•	What to answer: Always have at least two questions ready. Good examples: "Why is this position open?" (10:48) or "What does success look like in the first 90 days?" (10:59). Avoid questions about benefits in the first interview (11:06).
•	Why: Saying "No" signals disinterest (10:23). Asking thoughtful questions makes you memorable (11:15).
